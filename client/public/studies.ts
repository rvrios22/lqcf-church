    study: "Sunday Service",
    desc: `In our Sunday morning service, Pastor Mark Collins has been preaching through the Apostle Peter’s first epistle. The title of this series is “Hope in the Midst of Trials.” The way our world is going, we all could use a little hope. R.C. Sproul, in his Expositional Commentary on 1–2 Peter, says, “Imagine what it would be like to receive a letter from someone who was a personal friend of Jesus during His earthly ministry. Beyond that, imagine receiving two letters from such a person. That’s exactly what we have in the New Testament correspondence known as 1 & 2 Peter.” Come join us as we study through this amazing letter to the elect of God.`,

    study: "Wednesday Service",

Known as 'The chief part of the New Testament and the very purest gospel,' this book has profoundly impacted many, including the church father Augustine. The study aims to deepen our faith and understanding of Jesus Christ, who was delivered over to death for our sins and raised to life for our justification. Come grow in your knowledge and relationship with the Lord.",
